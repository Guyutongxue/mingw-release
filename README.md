Guyutongxue personal builds of MinGW-w64

Visit [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Guyutongxue/mingw-release/releases) to download.

## Issues

I'm using build scripts from [niXman/mingw-builds](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds), so **please submit your issue to [niXman's repo](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds/issues)**. This repository does not accept further issues.

Due to [brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw) now having Python support for GDB, so this repo may be useless, and won't update anymore.
